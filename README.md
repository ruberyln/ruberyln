i am Jesutofunmi ALabi, but you can call me JT. i am very passionate about human computer interaction, came back to school to do my masters in computer science , one for the reasons being i didnt like user experiences of most apps were, so i decided to learn and be at the fore-front of designing and developing applications. 
I am also passionate about fashion design, fashion design can be agile but we can talk about that later,  I  have a clear vision to incorpoate fashion and tech in emerging economies. My current project "The Couture COmpanion" focuses on this. its a client management system that helps fashion designers store their client information and also aid communication and client retention. 
Welp! thats a little about me, clearly i am a driven person with entreprenurial spirit and always looking to learn more. check out my repositories and see how i have grown.
